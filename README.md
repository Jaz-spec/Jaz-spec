# <div align="center"> Hi, I'm Jaz</div>


Full Stack Software developer with a background in community organising. This harnessed my natural ability to develop working relationships to plan and problem-solve in a team. Driven to collaborate on projects that deliver tech based solutions targeting social and environmental issues.
