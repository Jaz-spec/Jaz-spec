**Hi, I'm Jaz**

I have spent three years community organising and volunteering with land projects. I began developing my skill set as a software developer to enhance the community work that I was doing. I'm interested in providing people focused tech solutions and excited to collaborate on large scale projects that focus on social and environmental issues.Â
