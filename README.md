# <div align="center"> Hi, I'm Jaz</div>


I have spent three years community organising and volunteering with land projects. I began developing my skill set as a software developer to enhance the community work that I was doing. I'm interested in providing people focused tech solutions and excited to collaborate on large scale projects that focus on social and environmental issues.
